This is umm... A CMS that I made with Vanilla JS, FastAPI, and TinyDB. Not really... industry standard, but it's very, very easy to setup! It's perfect for slow traffic website like local cafe or someone's portfolio!

And I know how much you don't like Wordpress for all the Paywalls and all that, so... I hope this will be umm, a sufficient replacement!

I'm not saying that it's perfect, but I've added some Quality of Life features to make things easier for you.

## Features

- Admin panel
- Edit page URLs
- Optional AI help from [Aina Website Creator](https://github.com/Iteranya/Aina-Website-Creator) (for when the Client tells you to "make it pop!")
- Stores everything in TinyDB
- Made with very lightweight stuff:
  - FastAPI
  - JavaScript (vanilla flavor)
  - CSS
  - HTML with Jinja templates
  - OpenAI API for Aina Integration
- Comes with Cloudflare integration
- Generates static sites from Markdown (sometimes you just want something simple~)
- Basic image hosting
- Cookie-based security
  

## Installation

### For Windows Operators:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Iteranya/Amiya-CMS.git
cd Amiya-CMS
start.cmd 
```

### For Linux/MacOS Specialists:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Iteranya/Amiya-CMS.git
cd Amiya-CMS
// Handle the rest depending on your system
```

## Usage Instructions

1. Go to `/admin`
2. Edit website stuff
3. Let Aina's AI help with the UI and CSS
4. Or use Markdown like a normal person for something more old fashioned
5. Everything gets saved automatically

*"I'm not saying that this is better than Wordpress, but I feel like... Wordpress is a bit too much and setting it up can be really stressful with all the paywalls..."*

## So I Made This~

For when you're paid less than 20 LMD to make:
- Operator portfolio sites
- Local caf√© pages
- An alternative to Powerpoint Presentation
- And more~

*Not* for:
- Blacksteel enterprise solutions
- Rhodes Island main website (please)
- Anything expecting more than 5 visitors at once
